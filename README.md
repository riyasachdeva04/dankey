 ⚠️ Disclaimer: There is no guarentee that the memes are funny.

## Inspiration

Our inspiration for Dankey came from the desire to inject humor and creativity into everyday conversations. We recognized the power of memes to convey messages in a lighthearted and engaging manner.
What it does

Dankey, when integrated with WhatsApp chats, automatically generates memes based on the ongoing conversations. It serves as an interactive and entertaining addition to communication, allowing users to effortlessly add humor to their chats

## How we built it

Dankey's construction involved a multi-faceted approach, utilizing several technologies to bring our vision to life. We employed Baileys, a JavaScript library for WhatsApp, to facilitate communication with the messaging platform. Node.js and Express.js formed the backend infrastructure, orchestrating the integration of Dankey with WhatsApp.

On the data processing side, Python's pandas library played a crucial role. We leveraged pandas for efficient manipulation and analysis of data, ensuring seamless matching between incoming text messages and our diverse meme dataset.

This collaborative tech stack, combining Baileys, Node.js, Express.js, and Python pandas, allowed us to create a dynamic and interactive platform that seamlessly generates memes within the context of WhatsApp conversations.
